Project: Shri Kshetra Manjuguni Temple Website

Temple Information:
The website is built for "Shri Kshetra Manjuguni", a renowned Hindu temple located in Sirsi, Karnataka. It is widely known as the "Tirupati of Karnataka" and is dedicated to Lord Venkataramana and Goddess Padmavati. The temple is a significant pilgrimage center with a rich history and traditional architecture.

Work Summary:
I have developed a modern, responsive Single Page Application (SPA) for the temple using the following technologies:
- Frontend Library: React (v19)
- Build Tool: Vite
- Styling: Custom CSS (Flat Design)

Key Features Implemented:
1. **Hero Section**: A dynamic homepage with an automatic image slider and bilingual titles (English & Kannada).
2. **History Section**: A dedicated section showcasing the temple's history in a clean, horizontal grid layout.
3. **About Section**: Detailed information about the temple, presented in simple, static cards.
4. **Gallery**: A visual showcase of the temple, featuring a clean grid of images without complex zoom or lightbox effects, keeping the user experience simple.
5. **Visitor Information**: Comprehensive sections for Temple Timings, Location (with map integration), and Contact details.
6. **Donation Integration**: A feature to facilitate donations via UPI.
7. **Clean Code**: The codebase has been thoroughly cleaned of all comments and unnecessary artifacts to ensure a professional standard.
8. **Simplified Design**: All interactive elements (boxes, cards) have been styled with a "flat" design approach (no hover effects, shadows, or animations) as requested, ensuring a straightforward and distraction-free interface.
