## Image Optimization Tips:

- **Format**: Use JPG for photos (smaller file size)
- **Compression**: Optimize images to under 500KB each for faster loading
- **Aspect Ratio**: Maintain 3:2 or 4:3 for best display
- **Quality**: High quality but web-optimized

## How to Add Images:

1. Download or collect photos of Shri Venkataramana Temple, Manjuguni
2. Rename them exactly as listed above
3. Place them in this `public/images/` folder
4. The React app will automatically display them

## Note:

The website will work without images, but the gallery and hero section will show broken image icons until you add the photos. All layout and functionality will work perfectly once images are added.

The React development server will hot-reload automatically when you add the images!
