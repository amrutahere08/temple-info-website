## Image Optimization Tips:

- Use JPG format for photos (smaller file size)
- Compress images to under 500KB each for faster loading
- Maintain aspect ratio of 3:2 or 4:3 for best display
- Ensure images are high quality but web-optimized

## Note:

The website will work without images, but the gallery and hero section will show broken image icons until you add the photos. The layout and all functionality will work perfectly once images are added.
